      <h4>Lululemon Hero Section</h4>
      <p><tt>I have decided to use <a href="https://shop.lululemon.com/?CID=Google_All_PPC%2BBrand_CA_ag=Core_Lululemon+_Shop&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8_uk4cHM9QIVMQJ9Ch03MwxYEAAYASAAEgKcj_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds"> Lululemon </a> as my website example because their Call To Action is poignant. 
      <p>Target Audience: This website is geared to athletic wear. Customers looking for yoga, running and training gear would be the main audience. Lululemon does a good job of creating a Call To Action for holistic wellness- whether or not this is genuine in any way. They have generated a community of trendy clothing and athletic leisure wear that seems to speak more to a persons social status than the actual activity theyre performing. With so much effort put into maintaining the brand name- this target audience is not just for those who do yoga or run, but instead for anyone seeking a recognizable brand name.</p>
        <p><tt>The Value/Benefit Provided to Users: Lululemon has worked hard with excellent "wellness" marketing to establish a brand and image for healthy living. When a user navigates to their website the Hero Section of images and catch phrases portray healthy people doing activities in stylish, comfortable clothing. Lululemon always has new collections of clothing featured in the Hero Sections on the main page of their website. You can see below that color and catchy wording draw in the user- no excessive words, no busy photos. Just quick phrases and action inspired photos. </p>

      <h4>Call To Action Critique</h4>
      <p><tt>Lululemon uses their website well to deliver a  <strong>Call to Action</strong> with easily digestible, quick to read phrases. This website has <strong>Shop Now</strong> buttons on every hero section, dev section, so that any image that catches the users eye has a quick <strong>ACTION</strong> for the user to cleanly move towards purchase without confusion. Lululemon uses <strong>images</strong> and exciting <strong>color contrasts</strong> to draw the user in quickly- the images are simple, a person in movement. Most images show replicatbale movements or activities that the user can relate to and feel further inspired to make a purchase.</p>
        <div class="img-wrapper">
    <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97468502/150950133-212653f9-ebc0-4d0f-b944-566c19d968ed.png" alt="lulu CTA"> 
      </div>
          <p><tt>The use of <strong>white/negative space</strong> creates a clean and easy to take in visual appeal for the user. I really appreciate how Lululemon uses negative space to declutter what could be an overwhelming shopping experience- considering how many items they offer. An example of this overwhelm can be seen (in my opinion) above in the top image for Part 1 of Sportchek. This website very smoothly uses <strong>repetition</strong> of the <strong>Shop Now</strong> button. With some many of these buttons attached to appealing images it is very easy to purchase items you may not even have been looking for. As someone very succeptible to sensory overwhelm- I much prefer  online shopping. Lululemon has done a good job (in my opinion) of creating a simple shopping experience (which is exactly what their Call to Action is supposed to do) while upselling through a very appealing visual heirarchy.</p>
